# Conv
A unit converter made in C++

### How to use 
Conv uses command line arguments. Simply enter your value, unit to convert from, and unit to convert to, like so:
`./conv 40 m km`

If this feels a bit unnatural, you can use "to" in between:
`./conv 40 m to km`

Conv accepts a wide range of names for units. Abbreviations, full names, and plural forms all work.
